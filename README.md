## Goal
THe goal of this project is to observe different attributes of cyclones around the world during 2020 and see how to relate to each other. 
This is the website I used to extract my data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclones_in_2020?ref=pylenin

The attributes of the dataset are:
- Storm name: The name of the storm
- Dates active: The month and days the storm is active
- Max wind: The max wind speed of the cyclone in km/h
- Pressure: The pressure of the cyclone in hPa
- Areas affected: The areas that were devistated
- Damage: How badly the area was impacted
- Deaths: Total number of deaths
- Refs: Citations

### Challenges
The issues I faced when conducting the project was finding ways to make the data more readable and parseable. I had difficulties transforming nonnumerial data into numerical data so I ended up working with the few columns that were of int type to create my analysis. On that note, there is room for potential biases since the analysis made were based off only a few columns.
